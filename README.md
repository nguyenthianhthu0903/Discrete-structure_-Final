# Question 1: Euclid’s algorithm and Bezout’s identity.

a. Using Euclid’s algorithm to calculate gcd(2021, 1000 + m) and lcm(2021, 1000 +m), where m is the last 3 digits of your student ID.

Student ID is 51900564 => gcd(2021, 1564) and lcm(2021, 1564).

b. Apply above result(s) in to find 5 integer solution pairs (x,y) of this equation:

2021x + 1564y = gcd(2021, 1564)

# Question 2: Recurrence relation.

an = 8.an-1 – 15.an-2 witha0 =5anda1 =64

# Question 3: Set
Γ = {N, G, U, Y, E, T, H, I, A} Δ = {A, C, D, G, H, N, O, T, U}
Find the union, intersect, non-symmetric difference and symmetric difference of Γ and Δ.
# Question 4: Relations
Let R be a binary relation defined on 2 integers as follow:
∀𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ N (aRb↔64|(𝑎.𝑏))
# Question 5: Multiplicative inversion
a. Extended Euclidean algorithm
b. Find 65-1 (mod 101) by applying Extended Euclidean algorithm
# Question 6: Kruskal’s algorithm
Propose a solution for circuit-checking in Kruskal’s algorithm. Question 7: Eulerian circuit
